# Implementation Summary: User ID Tracking and Data Filtering

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to properly track user IDs and filter data by user across the university employment platform.

## Changes Made

### 1. Employer Job Listings (`app/dashboard/employer/job-listings/page.tsx`)
**Change**: Filter job listings to show only those posted by the current employer
- Added `user` from `useAuth()` hook
- Filter listings where `listing.poster_id === user?.id`
- This ensures employers only see their own job postings

### 2. Employer Applications (`app/dashboard/employer/applications/page.tsx`)
**Change**: Filter applications to show only those for the employer's job listings
- Load both applications and job listings
- Filter listings by `poster_id === user?.id`
- Filter applications where `listing_id` matches employer's listings
- Display applicant ID and submission date
- This ensures employers only see applications for their own job postings

### 3. Student Internships (`app/dashboard/student/internships/page.tsx`)
**Change**: Show only approved internship listings
- Changed from dedicated internships endpoint to job listings endpoint
- Filter for `is_internship === true` AND `approval_status === "Approved"`
- Updated apply function to use `apiClient.applyToJob()` with correct parameters
- This ensures students only see approved internship opportunities

### 4. Admin Pages Created

#### Professors Management (`app/dashboard/admin/professors/page.tsx`)
- Lists all professors with contact information
- Displays office location and subjects taught
- Uses `apiClient.getAllProfessors()`

#### Departments Management (`app/dashboard/admin/departments/page.tsx`)
- Lists all university departments
- Shows department head and building location
- Includes "Add Department" button for future functionality
- Uses `apiClient.getAllDepartments()`

#### Notifications Management (`app/dashboard/admin/notifications/page.tsx`)
- Lists all system notifications
- Shows notification type, target audience, and creation date
- Includes delete functionality
- "Create Notification" button for future functionality
- Uses `apiClient.getAllNotifications()` and `apiClient.deleteNotification()`

## Data Flow Architecture

### Employer Flow
1. Employer creates job listing → `poster_id` set to `user.id`
2. Job listing requires admin approval → `approval_status: "Pending"`
3. Admin approves listing → `approval_status: "Approved"`
4. Students can now see and apply to approved listings
5. Employer sees applications filtered by their `poster_id`

### Student Flow
1. Student completes profile → Updates student record with academic info
2. Student views internships → Sees only approved listings where `is_internship: true`
3. Student applies → Creates application with `applicant_id: user.id`
4. Application tracked by `listing_id` and `applicant_id`

### Admin Flow
1. Admin views pending employers → Filters by `approval_status: "Pending"`
2. Admin approves employer → Updates `approval_status: "Approved"`
3. Admin views pending job listings → Filters by `approval_status: "Pending"`
4. Admin approves listing → Updates `approval_status: "Approved"`
5. Admin manages professors, departments, and notifications

## Key ID Relationships

\`\`\`
User (Auth Service)
├── id (UUID)
├── user_type (STUDENT, EMPLOYER, ADMIN, etc.)
└── Used as foreign key in other services

Student (University Service)
├── id (matches User.id)
├── major, year, gpa, espb
└── Links to courses, exams

Employer (Employment Service)
├── id (matches User.id)
├── firm_name, pib, approval_status
└── poster_id in JobListing

JobListing (Employment Service)
├── id (UUID)
├── poster_id (references Employer.id)
├── approval_status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
└── is_internship (boolean)

Application (Employment Service)
├── id (UUID)
├── listing_id (references JobListing.id)
├── applicant_id (references User.id)
└── status (Pending, Reviewed, etc.)
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: All API calls require authentication token
2. **Data Isolation**: Users only see their own data through filtering
3. **Approval Workflow**: Employers and listings require admin approval
4. **ID Validation**: User IDs validated before database operations

## API Client Methods Used

All methods are available in `lib/api-client.ts`:
- `getJobListings()` - Get all job listings
- `getApplications()` - Get all applications
- `applyToJob()` - Create application
- `getAllProfessors()` - Get all professors
- `getAllDepartments()` - Get all departments
- `getAllNotifications()` - Get all notifications
- `deleteNotification()` - Delete notification

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Employer Testing**
   - Create job listing as Employer A
   - Verify Employer B cannot see Employer A's listings
   - Verify applications are filtered correctly

2. **Student Testing**
   - Verify only approved internships are visible
   - Test application submission
   - Verify rejected/pending listings are hidden

3. **Admin Testing**
   - Test approval workflows
   - Verify all data is visible to admin
   - Test notification management

## Future Enhancements

1. Add pagination for large datasets
2. Implement search and filter functionality
3. Add real-time notifications
4. Implement application status updates
5. Add bulk approval actions for admins
6. Create detailed application view pages
7. Add analytics dashboards
